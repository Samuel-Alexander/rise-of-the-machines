## Project Summary
This project is motivated by the desire to better understand and implement some of the more common machine learning trading algorithms. 

## Contributors:
* Val
* Felix
* Sam

## Libraries and Dependancies
* Alpaca API
* Python
* sklearn

## Steps
1. **Data Generation:** Gather and prepare historical return data for training and testing
2. **Train and compare multiple Machine Learning Algorithms:** Compare prediction performance of multiple ML-Algorithms on dimensions of accuracy, performanc, and efficiency (Sharpe Ratio). Alogorithms in scope:
  * Logistic Regression
  * RandomForestClassifier
  * GradientBoostingClassifier
  * AdaBoostClassifier
  * XGBClassifier
3. **Deployment:** Implement a fully functional trading algorithm that buys and sells the stocks selected by the Model
